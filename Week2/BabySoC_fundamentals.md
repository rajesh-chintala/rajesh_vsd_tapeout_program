## What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A **System-on-a-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that combines multiple essential components of a computer system into a single chip. Instead of using separate chips for processing, memory, and communication, an SoC integrates them together, making devices **smaller, faster, and more power efficient**.

SoCs are the backbone of **smartphones, tablets, wearables, IoT devices, and automotive electronics** because of their compactness and efficiency.

## Components of a Typical SoC

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- Executes instructions and controls system operation.

### Memory
- **RAM**: Used for temporary storage.  
- **ROM / Flash**: Used for permanent storage.

### Peripherals / I/O Interfaces
- Enable communication with sensors, USB devices, audio, cameras, and networks.

### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
- Handles image and video rendering.

### DSP (Digital Signal Processor)
- Optimized for signal processing tasks such as audio enhancement or communications.

### Analog / Mixed-Signal Components
- **DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter):** Converts digital signals to analog outputs.  
- **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop):** Provides stable clock signals for synchronization.  

### Power Management
- Ensures energy-efficient operation, crucial for battery-powered systems.

## BabySoC: A Simplified Model for Learning

**VSDBabySoC** is a compact SoC created for **educational and experimental purposes**.  
It captures the essence of a real-world SoC but keeps the design simple enough for beginners to understand.

### Key Elements
- **RVMYTH (RISC-V CPU):** The processor core that executes instructions and drives the overall system.  
- **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop):** Generates a synchronized clock signal to keep system components running in harmony.  
- **DAC (10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter):** Converts digital data processed by the CPU into analog signals, which can be fed to external devices such as displays or audio systems.  

By including these three major components, **BabySoC demonstrates the integration of digital logic, clock generation, and analog output**, providing a practical way to learn SoC concepts without the overwhelming complexity of industrial chips.
