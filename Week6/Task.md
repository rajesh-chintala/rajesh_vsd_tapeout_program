# Physical Design Workshop
Physical Design labs using a pre-configured VDI image and
understand the complete hierarchy of digital and mixed-signal design implementation â€”
from standard cell design to Design Rules Check (DRC) and Static Timing Analysis (STA) validation. Also Understand the interplay between layout, timing, and design rule checks (DRC)
and How physical design affects the final sign-off quality and silicon reliability
